# Cursor Rules for Warmup Worker Project

## Development Server Management
- NEVER run "npm run dev" or any server startup commands yourself
- ALWAYS assume the development server is already running at http://localhost:8787
- When changes are made that would benefit from testing, tell the user to try it out in their browser
- If any change requires a hard restart of the server, inform the user they need to restart it manually
- NEVER attempt to kill, restart, or manage the development server yourself unless explicitly told to do so

## Testing Changes
- After making code changes, suggest the user tests them by visiting the running application
- Use curl or similar tools only to verify the server is responding, not to start it
- Focus on explaining what the changes do rather than running the server
